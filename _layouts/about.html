    <h3>Hi, I'm James.</h3>
    <p>I've worked for two companies, Updater, a real estate tech startup, and FGX, a global IT deployment company. I'm an all around generalist, that has experience in negotation, sales, marketing, branding, design, and have a passion for understanding the gaps in-between these concepts. Currently, I am a sales and marketing director at FGX and am leading FGX in building our brand and finding product-market fit. This blog is a reflection of the things I'm reading and thinking about. Feel free to email me about anything at all!</p>
