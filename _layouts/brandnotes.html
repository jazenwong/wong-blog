      <li><p><strong>Turning away business for the right reasons is good for your brand.</strong> Turning away business might seem "bad" in the short-run because you turn away that revenue. But if done in-line with the company's values and properly communicated, it can positively influence the company's brand, resulting in more revenue in the long-run. At the company I work at, we turn away a lot of "low-value" business that would be relatively easy for us to execute but isn't in line with our brand and what we aim to do (to be the best at executing high-value deployments.) We may have lost revenue in the short-term, but we've been able to build a reputation for being the "high-value" player in the market. For example, every time a client brings us a project that is lower in value, we'll explain that it's not something we'll be cost effective at doing, and that we're built for high-value, complex deals (this is, of course, an abridged version.) In our client's minds, they start to relate our brand with "high-value," and whenever there's a high-value project, we'll have a better chance at being considered for it (they might even give us more weight in the consideration) â€” which is priceless.</p></li>
