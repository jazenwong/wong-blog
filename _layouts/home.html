      <p>5 of my favorite things on the internet (2/25/24):</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y">The AlphaGo documentary.</a> Great to rewatch given all of the developments in AI since the documentary was released in 2017. It's also more about the human condition than it is about machine learning, which is fascinating.</li>
        <li><a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian.</a> I have a lot of admiration for teams and companies that operate on a set of well thought out beliefs and principles. Obsidian has done a great job with this e.g. <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">file over app</a>. It's also just a well designed and thoughtful application.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.intercom.com/believe">Intercom's "believe" microsite.</a> Similarly to Obsidian, Intercom's microsite  puts forth a set of principles that guides their work and culture for the forseeable future. This brings clarity for all internal and external stakeholders. It's also great marketing; it has some of the best copy I've read in a long time. More companies should publish something like this.</li>
        <li><a href="https://sabrinas.space/">The peculiar case of Japanese web design.</a> Japan is known for its minimal and clean styles, yet their web design is the opposite of that. The author explores a few reasons for why this may be the case.</li>
        <li><a href="https://allhands.design/">All hands studio.</a> Run by <a href="https://twitter.com/_andresjasso">Andres Jasso</a>, they do a great job helping teams manifest their stories visually. I'm currently working with them on fgx's site design. I've spent a lot of time looking for a good design agency; they're a hidden gem.</li>
      </ul>
