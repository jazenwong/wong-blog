      <li><p>All designers should think about learning sales (and not just the salespeople at a firm.) Not the "car salesman" kind of sales, but the educational, question asking, problem uncovering sales. A lot of the times, the client isn't willing to accept a "better idea" because they can't or don't want to understand the concept. A good designer might give them an alternate solution. But the best designers who have the experience, will ensure that any misunderstandings are equalized before proposing alternatives.</p></li>
