description: The words "brand" and "design" are often thrown around in business. The words, however, have an important distinction that not many people have a good understanding of.

## A brand stems from the things a company believes, and expresses itself in many ways.

We envision creating a utility that allows companies to manage and move their IT infrastructure as easily as it is for people to use electricity in their everyday lives, giving them more control and agency.

Even now, when buyers use Centralized Deployment, they attain freedom over how they manage the physicality of their hardware. For example, buyers can rack and stack everything in one location, thus capturing economies of scale. They could even take material handling measures for securing their hardware prior to it being deployed to an international destination, e.g. GPS tracking on the asset level, accountability reporting, etc.

* Imagine a world where you start looking at your IT infrastructure as simple lego blocks. You can stack your legos in any way you’d like, in any way that’s best for you, and move them wherever you’d like, without constraint.

* Imagine a world where you can do load balancing in real time, anywhere on Earth.

* Imagine a world where your company is incentivized to foster interdepartmental communication and cooperation. Your network teams would be able to liaise with the security people, the audiovisual people, etc., so that while you’re building solutions, you can leverage your buying power in the most effective and efficient way to take advantage of your company’s size.

* Imagine a world where some smart entrepreneur that recognizes the other applications of commoditizing IT infrastructure can be, and creates a black box methodology that incorporates a reverse auction mechanism that consolidates the purchasing and anonymizes the buy side bid and thus commoditizes the supply side for the benefit of the buyer.

But what excites us the most is the fact that we can’t even begin to imagine the plethora of services and products that buyers and other companies can build on top of our utility to deliver themselves even more value.
