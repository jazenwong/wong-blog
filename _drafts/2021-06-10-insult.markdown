What is design that doesn't insult the user? What does that mean?

It implies that there is design that "insults" the user's intelligence. Making things really simple and easy to use is focused on attention span and removing the ambiguity effect - if people don't understand what they're looking at, they are more likely to just leave. This is a pretty safe approach for things that are utility based, like application design, website design, with the main function of converting and being useful.

But design that doesn't insult the user goes into it without assuming that the user will leave if they don't understand what they're looking at or doing in the first few moments. It gives them an opportunity to figure it out and explore. Probably more dangerous to use when the purpose is to convert and to be easily used. Up and downsides?
