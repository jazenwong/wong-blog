Collaborations, context, curation, curiosity


Collaborations are an exercise in curation. The collaborator has to find, vet, then work with a symbiotic brand that they think matches their product vision. They must curate. Curation is ever more powerful because there's too much content out there. A huge part of value is curation and providing context around a brand.

Collaborations make us curious. Collaborations gives us context about a brand. It's up to the consumer to figure why the collaboration works.

Collaborations are temporary. This makes the product from the collaboration inherently scarce - it's further amplified by the drop-model.
