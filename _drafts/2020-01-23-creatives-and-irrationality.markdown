## How Branders & Designers Handle Irrationality

Branders & designers have a hard job.

They have to take a whirlwind of product, culture, vision, rationality, irrationality and create something that represents or fairly expresses that, whether visually or through some other medium.

> Going back to Steve Jobs, arguably the most celebrated designer in our time, he understood that a brand consisted of a mixture of the measurable, logical components, but also the immeasurable, more irrational components like vision, creativeness, and instinct.

It's the reason why branders and designers often have a discovery stage with the client that consists of expectation management, questioning, and market research, which serves not only as a project brief, but as a trust building exercise.

Good designers ask thoughtful questions about their client's company, mission, their market, their competitors, etc. The _best_ designers, however, either consciously or subconsciously try to understand the true desire or feelings of their clients (the irrational), that's usually unexplainable with words. (This might resonate with those of you that have heard, "I don't know what I want, but I'll know when I see it.")

The feelings or desires that are unexplainable by the client are almost impossible to live up to, but they're important to address. This is where "sales" comes in, because in a way, the best designers are also very good salespeople. Of course, i'm not referring to the sleazy, always be closing, salespeople, but the empathetic and consultative salesperson who isn't willing to sacrifice their own or their company's standards and principles to close a deal.

Sales at its core is about empathizing and understanding the client and their desires, whether rational or irrational. Different type of salespeople do this differently â€” some prefer to meet with the client face to face because they're better at disseminating information in that way, some prefer communication over email, etc.

Through the process of trust building, empathizing, and asking good questions, irrationality becomes easier to manage.
