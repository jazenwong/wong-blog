There are many examples of where "turning away business" is good for a company's brand. It may sound counterintuitive but the psychology behind it is sound.

Think of all the times you wanted something but couldn't get it, how did it affect your feeling towards it? It made you want it even more. This applies to everything from wanting toys, brands, and of course, people.

An example of turning away business could be a company saying, "Sorry, we aren't a good fit for this project." Another example is scarcity marketing.

We'll discuss how each of these tactics can improve a company's sales and brand.

"Sorry, we aren't a good fit for this project."

Agencies, freelancers, consulting, and service firms, are often approached with business requests. It's not always wise, however, for a company to take on any and all jobs. It's important for a company to decide what their ideal job is and why. This will help them build towards the brand they want to be and get more "ideal jobs."

In the short-run, this is difficult to do, especially if you're a small business owner. But in the right circumstances, this can be a powerful branding strategy.

I'll share two examples: the company I work for, FGX, and Grow and Convert.

### FGX
For the sake of simplicity, I'll describe FGX as an international logistics company. FGX ships IT equipment for multinational businesses all around the world. Our ideal job is shipping high-value equipment, like network switches and servers. These projects are more profitable and better fit our business model of moving fast.

But, we're often approached by those same companies to ship lower-value IT equipment. Almost all the time, we say no to the business despite having the capacity to do those shipments. I would estimate that we've turned away a few million dollars worth of revenue over the past 3 years.

But every time that we turn away those lower-valued shipments, we tell the client why. We tell them, "FGX isn't built to support lower-value shipments. We'll be way too expensive. You're better off using FedEx. As you know, we focus on high-value, mission-critical shipments."

By admitting that we weren't good at lower-value shipments, clients gave us a positive. This is called the "Law of Candor."

In the client's mind, we've established a space for where we exist, which is invaluable. When they have a high-value shipment, they will think of us. By turning away business, we tell our clients not just who we are, but who we aren't — this is branding.

What about the lost revenue? We made that up and more in the high-value shipments that we won from those same clients.

### Grow & Convert
G&C are a content-marketing-as-a-service agency (that have awesome content on their blog.) On February of 2020, they made a post titled, []"Does Content Marketing Make Sense for Early Stage Companies? Our Thoughts."](https://growandconvert.com/content-marketing/does-content-marketing-make-sense-early-stage-companies/) In that post, they said:

They went onto explaining why they made this decision. As a reader and prospect, it made me respect them as an agency for three reasons.

The first reason is because it told me that they thought about what they were best at and why.

The second and third reasons are more psychological.

It made me feel that they were more "exclusive." Just because you wanted to work with them, didn't mean that you could. It made me want to work with them even more.

It also told me one more thing — that they were in a position to say no. They had enough business that they didn't have to take every single new client. If they have options and can turn away business, they must be good at what they do.

## Scarcity Marketing
Scarcity marketing is when a company limits the supply of a product or experience. Supply can refer to the duration or physical availability of a product.

Why is this effective?

Because limiting the supply of a product makes it more in demand. The crazy part is, even when customers know that supply is artificial, they will still line up.

### Nike
Nike's marketing of "Limited Release" shoes is a great example of this.

They have certain shoe lines that are high in demand. They don't sell them at any time and at any quantity. You must line up.

You line up via an online line, either on their website or their SNKRs app. For any given shoe, there will be an exact time where you must check-in on the app. If you're lucky enough, they congratulate you on "winning" the shoe, that you then have to pay for.

Now, of course Nike is more than capable of creating a gajillion shoes, and their customers know that. But even when the customers know that, it does not affect them the slightest.

Customers will get dozens of their friends (and sometimes even strangers) to line up for them.

Some people will flip these shoes. They know the demand still exists after the limited release, and re-sell the shoe at a higher price. Sometimes, the re-sell price of the shoe can go up to 5x the MSRP.

This is the power of scarcity marketing.

### Bah Kuh Teh
In Malaysia, there's a dish called, "Bah Kuh Teh." It's pork bone soup, and it's delicious.

There is a district that's famous for this dish, called Klang. If you want to eat Bah Kuh Teh at Klang, you must get there before 10 am, and ideally before 8 am. Why? Because they open at 4 am, sell out by 10 am and don't make any more.

Of course they could make more. But, it would most likely hurt their sales.

Bah Kuh Teh's great taste and limited supply makes it always in demand. There's never a day they don't sell out.

The funny part is, that the locals will come up with reasons for why they can't make any more. They do it to justify to themselves the exclusivity and quality of the product.

### One Last Example, Bakeries

Ever notice when you go to a bakery that there are whole cakes and cakes with one or two slices left?

Which cake seems more appealing?

Usually, the one with less slices. We think to ourselves, "that cake must be good, they sold so many slices." But, that thought process is purely psychological and not grounded in reality.

The whole cake might be a fresh one that's replacing the one that sold out. But yet, the cake with less slices stands out to us.

I bet it'll benefit bakeries to leave only 2 - 3 slices on a tray, instead of the whole cake.
