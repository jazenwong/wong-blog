A quick search on Google defines a brand as:

> A brand is a name, term, design, symbol or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.

This definition focuses on the superficial aspects of what makes up a brand. If a brand, however, was as simple as creating a memorable name and aesthetic logo, billion dollar companies would be created on a daily basis. Most marketers and branders know there's much more to branding than just a good logo, but oftentimes don't know exactly what that "more" is. This post is an attempt to give more insight into that "more."

## What is a Brand? The Importance of Distinctiveness
On the simplest level, a brand is a way for consumers to identify a seller. From the definition I shared earlier, the most important part of it was the bit on distinctiveness. Distinctiveness not only gives people a way to identify companies but also a way to reward them (by buying from them) when they like their products.

A good example of the importance of distinctiveness in branding can be found in how bees and flowers interact. When a bee finds a flower with better tasting nectar than other flowers, they will remember it based on the smell, look, and color of the flower. Without the smell and/or color of the flower, the bee wouldn't be able to find it again or tell its bee friends. This means that for the flower, it's just as important to have a distinctive look as it is to produce a good product, otherwise, having a good product is meaningless.

In a similar vein, businesses need their brands to have distinctive identities, so that consumers can remember, find, refer, and buy from them. Branding also helps the consumer, as it gives them a way to find trusted products that they like. Brands are a necessity for us to make decisions in the marketplace and are good for both the seller and the buyer.

## What is a Brand? More Than Just Distinctiveness
On a more nuanced level, branding isn't as simple as making a distinct identity. It isn't *just* a way for consumers to identify a seller, it's also the way consumers feel about, talk about, interact with a company, etc. A company can create a unique logo, name, and design in an attempt to paint a specific image of themselves, but more often than not, it doesn't stick. Ironically enough, even though its the company that invests in building their brand, they rarely are the ones to define what their brand stands for. Usually a brand is defined by everyone *except* the company that made the brand.

A fun example is the Timberland brand. You know, the famous yellowish colored shoes.

Jeffrey Swartz, the son of Sidney Swartz who made the first Timberlands himself, had a strong belief on what the Timberland shoe stood for.

> "It's about a crusty, no nonsense New England factory man, indifferent to anything but pure functionality." - Buying In, Rob Walker

The shoe itself was made to withstand the elements and to keep the wearer's feet warm—perfect for the working class people. They would advertise and brand their shoes by using working men in trucks and hiking trails.

But another group of people, not Timberland's target audience, white working men, started to take a liking to their shoes - [hip-hop and R&B artists](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/vb3gy9/how-hip-hop-coopted-a-boot-made-for-construction-workers). Vibe, a hip-hop lifestyle magazine, even paid tribute to the Timberland boots as being iconic to hip-hop in their September 2005 issue. An NYC museum also hosted had an exhibition called "Black Style Now" that included Timberland boots as part of "the global hip-hop uniform." Timberlands had caught on with a completely different market group than the one the founders had intended to sell to.

That, however, didn't stop Swartz from trying to control the brand's image by going onto Time magazines and saying:

> "Timberland is being adopted by a consumer that we didn't know existed relative to our target audience." Swartz said that while the hip-hop consumer's "money spends good," the fact remained that his brand was aimed primarily at "honest working people." - Buying In, Rob Walker

Of course this received backlash, but strangely enough, it didn't have any effect on the Timberland brand. This goes to show that, ultimately, no matter how hard one tries to brand their company a certain way, the final decision isn't up to them. The brand stands for what the consumers and people believe it stands for.

## Branding is Reputation
Branding is most similar to reputation, in the sense that a brand's value is based on what others think about it and not how they've defined personally themselves. Whenever you have to take into account human perception and behavior, things become tricky.

![Quote from Neil Degrasse Tyson](/assets/blogimages/NeilDegrasseTysonQuote.png#center "Neil Degrasse Tyson Quote")

There isn't a 10-step process for guaranteeing that you'll make a great brand. Creating a brand isn't reductive in nature, it's closer to shooting in the dark and listening for the pings.

I like to think of a brand as an idea that exists within a person's neural network. Whenever we humans are exposed to or learn something, our brains fire off neurons and start creating neural connections. Whether we're learning about math, politics, or business, we're creating connections within our brains. With enough study, those connections together paint a story or opinion on a particular subject. These connected stories and opinions form the brand in consumer's minds, and usually subconsciously. So, brands are created, in a way, by the subconscious study of a company or thing. Once these stories have reached enough people, the general consensus forms an agreement on that brand's reputation and what that brand stands for.

Anything the brand does, from the product it sells to its logo, needs to leave a neural mark on the consumers brain (which is where distinctiveness comes in)—you can consider this as the table stakes. Good brands, however, try to strengthen the consumer's idea of them in a "positive way" by associating their company with different sorts of things, like their logo, a good website, marketing efforts, sales efforts, etc. Because neural connections are hard to make, great branding takes resources, time, and a ton of luck. Great brands aren't made overnight.

## What Makes a Great Brand?
It's hard to say... I don't think there's a definition that would make everyone happy. People just *know* when a brand approaches or is in that territory.

In my opinion, I think the thing all great brands have in common is that they have created many "stories." Stories can be anything that leaves an impression on a person's mind. They can be found in a company's website design, case studies, the founder's story, an event they hosted, anything. It's the accumulation and subconscious study of these stories that create a brand in a consumer's mind. I'll give three examples, one of a company, a person, and a typeface.

### Apple
When we think of great branding, many people immediately think of Apple. Apple has had a plethora of stories, from the legendary story of Steve Jobs to the way they design their products, to the Apple WWDC events that started in 1987. Every effort from big to small combines to subconsciously create an idea of what a brand stands for. There are certainly events that weight than others, like Apple's "Think Different" campaign, but ultimately, it's the cumulative efforts that defines a brand in the long-run.

Apple since its inception, but mostly during the years Steve Job was present, has created stories. Jobs was focused on the design of everything Apple was involved in, from the products to storefronts to the Apple campus—his attention to Apple's work was a story in of in itself! Jobs had a way of telling stories in everything he did, which was just as powerful as the outcomes that he had produced.

Part of the reason for why—I think—people started "doubting" Apple is because after Job's passed away, the "great" stories stopped. Side Note: I don't want this to be confused with the definition of stories I set earlier, because for sure, Apple has continued to create stories by hosting events, conferences, creating great ads, etc., but since the passing of Jobs, they've lost the ability to tell "great" stories.

Steve Jobs is the biggest reason for why Apple's brand is as valuable as it is. He was a storyteller and that reverberated throughout the organization.

The frequency and volume is the most important thing, and the  

It is important to have a good typeface because even caring about it is a story in of initself!


Stories are the most powerful tool we have for creating an imprint into people's minds.

Interestingly enough, although it helps for the stories to be related or having a common underlying theme, it's not necessary.



People will find a way to confirm their biases.
