A quick search on Google defines a brand as:

> A brand is a name, term, design, symbol or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.

This definition focuses on the superficial aspects of what makes up a brand. If a brand, however, was as simple as creating a memorable name and aesthetic logo, billion dollar companies would be created on a daily basis. Most marketers and branders know there's much more to branding than just a good logo, but oftentimes don't know exactly what that "more" is. This post is an attempt to give more insight into that "more."

## What is a Brand? The Importance of Distinctiveness
On the simplest level, a brand is a way for consumers to identify a seller. From the definition I shared earlier, the most important part of it was the bit on distinctiveness. Distinctiveness not only gives people a way to identify companies but also a way to reward them (by buying from them) when they like their products.

A good example of the importance of distinctiveness in branding can be found in how bees and flowers interact. When a bee finds a flower with better tasting nectar than other flowers, they will remember it based on the smell, look, and color of the flower. Without the smell and/or color of the flower, the bee wouldn't be able to find it again or tell its bee friends. This means that for the flower, it's just as important to have a distinctive look as it is to produce a good product, otherwise, having a good product is meaningless.

In a similar vein, businesses need their brands to have distinctive identities, so that consumers can remember, find, refer, and buy from them. Branding also helps the consumer, as it gives them a way to find trusted products that they like. Brands are a necessity for us to make decisions in the marketplace and are good for both the seller and the buyer.

## What is a Brand? More Than Just Distinctiveness
On a more nuanced level, branding isn't as simple as making a distinct identity. It isn't *just* a way for consumers to identify a seller, it's also the way consumers feel about, talk about, interact with a company, etc. A company can create a unique logo, name, and design in an attempt to paint a specific image of themselves, but more often than not, it doesn't stick. Ironically enough, even though its the company that invests in building their brand, they rarely are the ones to define what their brand stands for. Usually a brand is defined by everyone *except* the company that made the brand.

A fun example is the Timberland brand. You know, the famous yellowish colored shoes.

![Timbs](/assets/blogimages/TimberlandShoe.jpg#center "Timberland Shoe")

Jeffrey Swartz, the son of Sidney Swartz who made the first Timberlands himself, had a strong belief on what the Timberland shoe stood for.

> "It's about a crusty, no nonsense New England factory man, indifferent to anything but pure functionality." - Buying In, Rob Walker

The shoe itself was made to withstand the elements and to keep the wearer's feet warm—perfect for the working class people. They would advertise and brand their shoes by using working men in trucks and hiking trails.

![Timberland Ad](/assets/blogimages/TimberlandAd.jpeg#center "Timberland Ad")

But another group of people, not Timberland's target audience, white working men, started to take a liking to their shoes - [hip-hop and R&B artists](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/vb3gy9/how-hip-hop-coopted-a-boot-made-for-construction-workers). Vibe, a hip-hop lifestyle magazine, even paid tribute to the Timberland boots as being iconic to hip-hop in their September 2005 issue. An NYC museum also hosted had an exhibition called "Black Style Now" that included Timberland boots as part of "the global hip-hop uniform." Timberlands had caught on with a completely different market group than the one the founders had intended to sell to.

That, however, didn't stop Swartz from trying to control the brand's image by going onto Time magazines and saying:

> "Timberland is being adopted by a consumer that we didn't know existed relative to our target audience." Swartz said that while the hip-hop consumer's "money spends good," the fact remained that his brand was aimed primarily at "honest working people." - Buying In, Rob Walker

Of course this received backlash, but strangely enough, it didn't have any effect on the Timberland brand. This goes to show that, ultimately, no matter how hard one tries to brand their company a certain way, the final decision isn't up to them. The brand stands for what the consumers and people believe it stands for.

## Branding is Reputation
Branding is most similar to reputation, in the sense that a brand's value is based on what others think about it and not how they've defined personally themselves. Whenever you have to take into account human perception and behavior, things become tricky.

![Quote from Neil Degrasse Tyson](/assets/blogimages/NeilDegrasseTysonQuote.png#center "Neil Degrasse Tyson Quote")

There isn't a 10-step process for guaranteeing that you'll make a great brand. Creating a brand isn't reductive in nature, it's closer to shooting in the dark and listening for the pings.

I like to think of a brand as an idea that exists within a person's neural network. Whenever we humans are exposed to or learn something, our brains fire off neurons and start creating neural connections. Whether we're learning about math, politics, or business, we're creating connections within our brains. With enough study, those connections together paint a story or opinion on a particular subject. These connected stories and opinions form the brand in consumer's minds, usually subconsciously, and they'll suddenly decide they like, dislike, love, or hate the brand. So, brands are created, in a way, by the subconscious study of a company, person, or thing. Once these stories have reached enough people, through word of mouth, the general consensus forms an agreement on that brand's reputation and what that brand stands for.

![Branding Quote](/assets/blogimages/BrandingQuote.png#center "Branding Quote")

Anything the brand does, from the product it sells to its logo, needs to leave a neural mark on the consumers brain (which is where distinctiveness comes in)—you can consider this as the table stakes. Good brands, however, try to strengthen the consumer's idea of them in a "positive way" by associating their company with different sorts of things, like their logo, a good website, marketing efforts, sales efforts, etc. But more than that, great brands try to create a "relationship" with the consumer. Great branding takes resources, time, and a ton of luck. Great brands aren't made overnight.

## What Makes a Great Brand?
It's hard to say... I don't think there's a definition that would make everyone happy, but I think that's okay. Whether a brand can be considered great is based on your own personal criteria. To some people, a brand might be great and to some it might not be - but maybe that's where the secret lies. Great brands are decided in the eyes of the beholder and in today's age, companies don't dictate brand worth, the individual does.

> "It was you that was important, and everything else would define you after you defined yourself. It wasn't like a brand defined you, you defined the brand." - Chuck D. (Public Enemy)

If this is the case, and everything is up to individual consumer's opinions, then how can we ever make a "great brand?" The secret to great branding lies in understanding relationships. People often "like" things and other people, which lasts only momentarily. Most people will have like many people and things on and off during their lifetime, but will not "love" many things.

When someone loves their S.O., they will choose them over anyone else, even if the "alternatives" are better in every single way. Then when you ask the person why they love their S.O., they will often start thinking of the reasons on the spot. Before that moment, they might not have even consciously thought about why they love their S.O., but will then come up with a multitude of reasons. They will say that they love the fact that their S.O. is funny, good looking, career-focused, but even if they found that same combination of things in another person, they would still love their S.O.

The love that people have for their loved ones is what brands (specifically company brands and not people brands) want to achieve with their customers (although nearly impossible.) Of course I'm not talking about the passionate love, but the emotive love, the love people have for their iPhones, movies like Star Wars, the list goes on. People will defend the brands they love just like they defend their loved ones. When asked why they love a certain brand, they'll say, oh I love their products, their customer service, what they stand for, etc. They won't know exactly why, but will come up with reasons to defend the brand.

But so what if brands are like relationships? We're still left with the question - how do we make a great brand? Like being a great partner, to be a great brand, you first must be... yourself. This is a cliche, but I think it makes sense. People won't like you as a person or a brand if they feel like you're pandering to them or their subgroup. People will like you, however, if you are yourself and stand for something you believe in (but this doesn't mean stand for a political view, which I'll discuss further below.) People will find things about you, whether true or not, to like, and will love your brand - not because you asked for them to be, but because they themselves decided to.

If you're thinking, "That's stupid, just be myself? How does that work? Where's the market research? We need to build what the consumer wants!" Market research is important and has its place, which would take a whole other post to talk about, but it is less important than being yourself. The things we create as people and brands come from a deep sense of ourselves and who we are. Bob Iger, ex-CEO of Disney, described this well in his Masterclass:

> "Collecting data about that marketplace in order to determine what story you tell or how you tell that story, to me, is a waste of time. I don't think you ever learn enough from data about what a marketplace would want in terms of story or how a marketplace might even react to a story. That decision needs to be based more on gut instinct and on confidence you may have in the creative entity that's telling the story. I'm not a big believer in doing research that any way leads to an answer to the question what does an audience want. I typically believe that research when you bring a creative product to market beforehand doesn't do you much good. It doesn't create a roadmap, doesn't in any way end up as a positive in terms of what you create or how you create it. The collection of data needs to be complimented by the collection of real time experience. That learning about a market by looking at numbers on a computer screen might give you some insights but not all the insights you necessarily need. One way I like collecting information the most is experience. I like traveling the world, I like interacting with consumers as much as possible to get a better understanding of the marketplace and consumers in general. One of the things I say often to people is if you don't go, you can't grow. What I mean by that is you have to go to a market, on the ground in the market, and touch, and feel, and listen to, and see the market that you're in to gain a better sense of what that market is. A great example would be doing business in India. You could sit in your office in LA and study India all you want. But you're never going to learn as much as you would learn if you go there and see the sights and sounds and smells and touch the market and its people in a very, very direct way." - Bob Iger, A Ride of a Lifetime

There's also a ton of proof out there that shows "being yourself" and finding ways to be yourself is truly what's most important, whether you're selling B2C or B2B services. Look at our earlier example of Timberlands. Timberland focused on being themselves, a shoe for hard working people, and a completely different group of people than they had expected to buy it loved and immortalized their product.

In the mainstream, we saw this with Apple. Steve Jobs, from the start, had always been himself and led Apple with that energy. He believed that we are all individuals with our own creative energies. He infused himself (his and Apple's brand) into everything he did, from his public speeches, to Apple's marketing (Think Different.) He knew who he was, what he stood for, and what he wanted—he was a leader, and people gravitate towards leaders. In the relationship analogy, you've likely heard that before you get into a relationship, you should find yourself. A brand must know itself before others can love it.

## Some Rebuttals
Before I discuss rules that brands can follow to try to "be themselves," I think it's important to talk about the truth. The truth is, businesses are made to make money. Let's not lie to ourselves. Nowadays, consumers are educated and will call out bullshit when they see it. A company isn't fooling anybody when they "stand up" to social injustice (even if it helps.) People know or at least will always suspect that a company is doing something for monetary gain.

Only people can stand for something - it's why Steve Jobs is a legend. He was one of the first to stand for something and by relation it applied to his brand. But there was something important that Steve Jobs did when it came to "standing for something." He didn't stand for a social cause. He stood up for things that were related to Apple as a company and its products. It wasn't fluff for the sake of pandering to a political cause.

[Here's an example of Steve Job's famously standing up to a customer's critique of his decision making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FF-tKLISfPE).

[Here's a great segment of Trevor Noah talking about companies and pandering instead of standing for something.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nma4GJ2rfwU&list=PLeskMkEaHJYfIUSU8jfEQ45x7qP4_pzl9&index=89).

Jobs built stories around his products, talked about what he hoped his products would achieve, and who he would want to use them. He didn't associate the brand to a political agenda just because it was hot with his customers. He focused on building stories around his product.

**The key to building great brands is to create great stories.** They leave strong neural marks on the consumer and travel through word of mouth; stories are what creates great brands. A company "being itself" is the philosophy that helps people in the company make good decisions (in their product, sales, marketing, etc. strategies) for their brand.

## Being Yourself
Although there are many ways for a company to "be itself," I think there are a few ground rules that brands (and people) should follow if they wish to build a great relationship with a consumer. Great brands, like great partners in relationships, must have: Honesty, Confidence, Consistency, and sometimes, Transparency.

(If we believe that great brands are akin to great partners, then we need to determine what makes up a great partner. Although this is my opinion, I think that when we examine our relationships, we will find that more often than not, these traits are important to all healthy relationships.)

Also, these traits are powerful because they have the ability to spread quickly. When consumers hear stories about people and brands acting with these traits, word of mouth quickly spreads their stories like wildfire, which builds their brand reputation.

A great example of a brand that has "been itself" is League of Legends. The game has never linked its value to any causes. Instead, it focused on itself and building stories around itself. Riot Games, the founder of League has invested resources in creating an endless amount of stories in the League universe, and it has paid off. They've created content that has never existed in games before, going as far as to create popular music bands with their characters. They've found a way to "be themselves" in their products they create.

Riot Games trail-blazed the way for e-sports and gaming in mainstream media. Standing up for e-sports made sense, consumers knew it was genuine and they championed the brand. Their branding in the e-sports scene has been so great that if investors know that Riot is behind a game, they will immediately invest in its competitive scene.

> "Any game that Riot releases is already held high in our minds, because the e-sports ecosystem for League of Legends is so well done, so naturally we expect a lot of these strengths to carry over into any new e-sports ecosystem that they want to develop." - Team Secret's CEO

Riot created a strong brand reputation by being themselves and focusing on their product. The stories that were generated from their product and everything they did with their product (champion releases, gaming events, game philosophy and transparency, personnel hires, etc.) is what created their brand over time. And although the tactics they used varied across the decade, each decision was fueled by honesty, confidence, consistency, and transparency.

### Honesty
Firstly, to build a great brand, we have to be honest with ourselves and understand that companies are built to make money. Brands should "stand for" themselves, their products, and their decision making. Standing for anything else is pretty far fetched and will be taken as not completely genuine, unless you're a non-profit organization or doing charity work. If you want to stand for a cause, you must tread lightly. You do not want your brand to equal the cause, because then people will only buy from you because of the cause. When that fad dissipates, so will your brand. You can certainly support a cause, but make sure what cause and how you're supporting that cause is in-line with your company and it's "product."

### Confidence
When I list confidence, I'm not referring to the "alpha male," "chad-like" confidence. I'm talking about having confidence in who you are and what you stand for. Great brands have confidence in the products they build, the people they hire, and decisions they make. Another example is how Jon Stewart, the ex-host of the Daily Show, runs his show. He will give hard interviews, call-out people when he believes they're wrong, and puts his money where his mouth is at.

He built an incredible brand for the show and many recognize his show to be a more credible and honest source of news than any news network. When people look to the Daily Show, they will expect that the host now and in the future carry those values.

### Consistency
It doesn't matter if you have values and are confident about sharing and defending them if you aren't consistent. People heavily criticized Nike when they decided to pull a shoe brand from their shelves in China because the shoe was Anti-Beijing. People also criticized Nike when their partner in China, the NBA, "gave in" to the Chinese government with their statement saying:

//

How do I get people to find me? Is another question. Marketing. You still have marketing and stuff but in those events, you must be yourself. So the question then is, how do you attract consumers? How do you attract friends and people into your life? You can go meet people at school (networking events / sales,)



Branding is relationship between the brand and the consumer.


CONFIDENCE, CONSITENCY - doesnt mean don't cahnge, TRANSPARENCY

The thing that all great brands have in common is that they have created many "stories." Stories can be anything that leaves an impression on a person's mind. They can be found in a company's website design, case studies, the founder's story, an event they hosted, anything. It's the accumulation and subconscious study of these stories that create a brand in a consumer's mind. I'll give three examples, one of a company, a person, and a typeface.
