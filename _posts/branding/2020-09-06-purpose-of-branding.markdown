A quick search on Google defines a brand as:

> A brand is a name, term, design, symbol or any other feature that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers.

This definition focuses on the superficial aspects of what makes up a brand. If a brand, however, was as simple as creating a memorable name and aesthetic logo, billion dollar companies would be created on a daily basis. Most marketers and branders know there's much more to branding than just a good logo, but oftentimes don't know exactly what that "more" is. This post is an attempt to give more insight into that "more."

## What is a Brand? The Importance of Distinctiveness
On the simplest level, a brand is a way for consumers to identify a seller. From the definition I shared earlier, the most important part of it was the bit on distinctiveness. Distinctiveness not only gives people a way to identify companies but also a way to reward them (by buying from them) when they like their products.

A good example of the importance of distinctiveness in branding can be found in how bees and flowers interact. When a bee finds a flower with better tasting nectar than other flowers, they will remember it based on the smell, look, and color of the flower. Without the smell and/or color of the flower, the bee wouldn't be able to find it again or tell its bee friends. This means that for the flower, it's just as important to have a distinctive look as it is to produce a good product, otherwise, having a good product is meaningless.

In a similar vein, businesses need their brands to have distinctive identities, so that consumers can remember, find, refer, and buy from them. Branding also helps the consumer, as it gives them a way to find trusted products that they like. Brands are a necessity for us to make decisions in the marketplace and are good for both the seller and the buyer.

## What is a Brand? More Than Just Distinctiveness
On a more nuanced level, branding isn't as simple as making a distinct identity. It isn't *just* a way for consumers to identify a seller, it's also the way consumers feel about, talk about, interact with a company, etc. A company can create a unique logo, name, and design in an attempt to paint a specific image of themselves, but more often than not, it doesn't stick. Ironically enough, even though its the company that invests in building their brand, they rarely are the ones to define what their brand stands for. Usually a brand is defined by everyone *except* the company that made the brand.

A fun example is the Timberland brand. You know, the famous yellowish colored shoes.

Jeffrey Swartz, the son of Sidney Swartz who made the first Timberlands himself, had a strong belief on what the Timberland shoe stood for.

> "It's about a crusty, no nonsense New England factory man, indifferent to anything but pure functionality." - Buying In, Rob Walker

The shoe itself was made to withstand the elements and to keep the wearer's feet warm—perfect for the working class people. They would advertise their shoes by using working men in trucks and hiking trails.

But another group of people, not the traditional white working men that was Timberland's market audience, started to take a liking to Timberlands - [hip-hop and R&B artists](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/vb3gy9/how-hip-hop-coopted-a-boot-made-for-construction-workers). Vibe, a hip-hop lifestyle magazine, even paid tribute to the Timberland boots as being iconic to hip-hop in their September 2005 issue. An NYC museum also hosted had an exhibition called "Black Style Now" that included Timberland boots as part of "the global hip-hop uniform". Timberlands had caught on with a completely different market group than the one the founders had intended to sell to.

That, however, didn't stop Swartz from trying to control the brand's image by going onto Time magazines and saying:

> "Timberland is being adopted by a consumer that we didn't know existed relative to our target audience." Swartz said that while the hip-hop consumer's "money spends good," the fact remained that his brand was aimed primarily at "honest working people." - Buying In, Rob Walker

Of course this received backlash, but strangely enough, it didn't have any effect on the Timberland brand. This goes to show that, ultimately, no matter how hard one tries to brand their company a certain way, it's not up to them. The brand stands for what the consumers and people believe it stands for.

## Branding is Reputation
Branding is most similar to reputation, in the sense that a brand's value is based on what others think about it and not how they've defined personally themselves. Whenever you have to take into account human perception and behavior, things become tricky.

There isn't a 10-step process for guaranteeing that you'll make a great brand. Creating a brand isn't reductive in nature, it's closer to shooting in the dark and listening for the pings.

I like to think of a brand as an idea that exists within a person's neural network. Whenever we humans is exposed to or learn something, our brains fire off neurons and start creating neural connections. Whether we're learning about math, politics, or business, we're creating connections within our brains that together paint a story or opinion on a particular subject. These connected stories and opinions form the brand in consumer's minds, and usually subconsciously. So, brands are created, in a way, by the subconscious study of a company or thing. Once these stories have reached enough people, the general consensus forms an agreement on that brand's reputation and what that brand stands for.

Anything the brand does, from the product it sells to its logo, needs to leave a neural mark on the consumers brain (which is where distinctiveness comes in)—you can consider this as the table stakes. Good brands, however, try to strengthen the consumer's idea of them in a "positive way" by associating their company with different sorts of things, like their logo, a good website, marketing efforts, sales efforts, etc. Because neural connections are hard to make, good branding takes resources and time. Good brands aren't made overnight.
