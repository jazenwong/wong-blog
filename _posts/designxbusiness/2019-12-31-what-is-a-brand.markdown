The concept of a brand is very ethereal — it's hard to define what a brand is, let alone to define what makes a brand "good." When someone says, "wow, that company has great branding!", what does that really mean? To a designer, a brand may be analogous to cohesive and meaningful visual identity. But to a business person, a brand may be the products and services the company sells.

A brand, however, is neither just a company's visual identity or their products and services. It's also the story of a company, what it stands for, the culture, etc., the list goes on. The things that make-up a "brand" are just as much an art as it is a science — a brand's components exists in a grey area.

This grey area is the reason why businesses — the ones who are _supposed_ to know themselves best — hire branding or design experts and agencies to help them create a brand. The brander's job is to help their clients create order out of chaos and to create meaningful form from function. But as hard as the company or brander tries, they themselves can't determine if their brand "exists", or if their brand is "good", they need validation from outsiders and their users.

All one can do is to try checking as many boxes as possible, as well as possible, in hopes that it results in their market recognizing their brand as "good". For the deterministic-minded people, typically businesspeople, this is probably an unsettling idea (I very much empathize with this feeling, as I myself am the type of person who finds comfort in following a process in pursuit of a guaranteed result.) Conversely, for the indeterministic, there may be relief in not having to follow a ten-step recipe to success.

> There's a great post by [Felicia Sullivan](https://medium.com/s/how-to-build-a-brand/lets-talk-about-how-to-build-a-brand-543b2dfbc4f5) that lists the many components of what she rightfully believes goes into creating a brand. One can certainly follow it to check-off many boxes for creating a brand, but the purpose of this thought-piece is not to talk about the exact components of a brand, but to reflect on the nature of a brand.

## The Nature of a Brand's Components

In the business world, decisions are typically made by using "logic," and anything that isn't "rational" or "logical", is considered not worth spending time on and is quickly thrown out the window. In the context of branding, this "logical" dogma is a dangerous one to subscribe to because it only allows a brand to be created via reductionist logic.

Reductionist logic is the sort of logic that a traditional economist would apply to pricing. For example, assuming that lowering of price will increase in sales. Rory Sutherland's book, Alchemy, describes the issue of this dogma well:

> "Unfortunately, because reductionist logic has proved so reliable in the physical sciences, we now believe it must be applicable everywhere — even in the much messier field of human affairs. The models that dominate all human decision-making today are duly heavy on simplistic logic, and light on magic... what if, in our quest to recreate the certainty of the laws of physics, we are now too eager to impose the same consistency and certainty in fields where it has no place?"

There are some that don't obey this dogma — let's call them "creatives" because we typically find these kind of people in the creative field — that instinctively seem to understand that there's an "irrational," less straight-forward and logical component to a brand. (In my opinion, this difference in philosophy between strict adherence to reductive logic and not is the reason for most disconnects between businesspeople and creatives.)

This irrationality, although hard to rationalize, understand, or express, is crucial to a brand. It's not welcomed by most businesspeople, because it's not something they can back-up with reductionist logic when speaking to their superiors or boardroom. Another reason why irrationality is hard for people to accept is because often times there are no definite success metrics that can be directly attributed to it.

This makes it very difficult for irrationality or "magic" as Sutherland calls it to take part in a brand. (This isn't to say that there isn't a logical process for developing the more creative / "irrational" aspects of a brand, because there are, and plenty of creatives have their own methodologies.)


## The Case for Irrationality

Steve Jobs was famous for his obsession for wanting just the right shade of white for Apple's products, and rounded corners. This neuroticism, however, was not understood by the "rational" people around him. At the time, that was Mike Scott (newly brought in president of Apple for the purpose of "reigning in" Jobs) and even his co-founder, Steve Wozniak.

Although many could argue that the shade of white or the roundness of corners wouldn't have really mattered, that's only easy to say in hindsight. Let's imagine a world where Apple hired a market research firm to look into which colors would be most popular using surveys, focus groups, etc. Now imagine they came back with any color **but** white...

> That's not to say that market research doesn't have its place — because it certainly does, it's just that it's not _always_ correct or even safe to listen to. To be fair, the irrationality that Sutherland describes is more about using psycho-logic (heuristics, behavioral economics, etc.) to come up with unconventional solutions, instead of using simple reductionist logic (e.g. raw market research).

The frustrating part about irrationality is that... well, it's "irrational" and hard to explain. And even when explained, like when Jobs told his team that the search for pure white was important because it made the products feel high-tech, it's still was hard to accept, because it's seemingly subjective.

There isn't a definitive answer for how and when to accept irrationality in the brand building process, but I am a firm believer that one should create the products one would use themselves, especially when one feels strongly about something. Because if one ends up creating a product or design they don't resonate with themselves, they may end up detesting the product (and not being able to genuinely sell or market it).

> Typically, branders and designers are the creatives that are hired to bridge the rational and irrational for the client (whether hired internally or outsourced). Their job is to help the client realize their vision and guide them to answers they may or may not have known. [Here](https://thewonger.com/creatives-and-irrationality), you can read more about how they can manage that.

Being able to genuinely sell or market something can be just as, if not more valuable, than having a product or design that was born out of pure market research. The problem with surveying, statistics, etc. is that people often don't know how they would react to something until put into the real-life situation. Like Henry Ford famously said, ""
