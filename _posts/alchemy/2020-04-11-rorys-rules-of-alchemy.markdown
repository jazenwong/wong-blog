4. The nature of our attention affects the nature of our experience.

5. A flower is simply a weed with an advertising budget.

6. The problem with logic is that it kills of magic.

7. A good guess which stands up to observation is still science. So is a lucky accident.

8. Test counterintuitive things only because no one else will.

9. Solving problems using rationality is like playing golf with only one club.
