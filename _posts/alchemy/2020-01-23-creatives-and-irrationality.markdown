1. The opposite of a good idea can also be a good idea.

2. Don't design for average.

3. It doesn't pay to be logical if everyone else is being logical.

4. The nature of our attention affects the nature of our experience.

5. A flower is simply a weed with an advertising budget.

6. The problem with logic is that it kills of magic.

7. A good guess which stands up to observation is still science. So is a lucky accident.

8. Test counterintuitive things only because no one else will.

9. Solving problems using rationality is like playing golf with only one club.

10. Dare to be trivial.

11. If there were a logical answer, we would have found it.
