"Logical" thinking often isn't applicable in marketing and design. For example, if you were tasked with making a competitor to Coke, strict "logical" thinking may sound something like:

> <strong>"We need to produce a drink that tastes nicer than Coke, that costs less than Coke, and that comes in a really big bottle so people get value for money." (page ix)</strong>

Makes sense right? If we market a product that's in every way "better" than Coke, we'll succeed in competing with Coke.

But what if we marketed a product that's "worse tasting" than Coke, more expensive, and comes in a small bottle? Could that succeed? Turns out, it can â€” enter Red Bull.

After a research agency conducted a study on consumer reaction to the flavor of Red Bull, it reported that people hated the taste. Yet, Red Bull disregarded it and went with the their original flavor, and to this day, Red Bull is one of the most successful beverages in the market.
