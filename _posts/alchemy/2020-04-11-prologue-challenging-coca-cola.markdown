## Summary:

"Logical" thinking often isn't applicable in reality. For example, if you were tasked with making a competitor to Coke, a logical thinker may think something like:

<strong>"We need to produce a drink that tastes nicer than Coke, that costs less than Coke, and that comes in a really big bottle so people get value for money." (page ix)</strong>

Makes sense right? But there's one beverage that is worse tasting than Coke, more expensive, and comes in a small bottle that rivals Coke — Red Bull. It doesn't pay to always be logical.


## My Comments:

This reminds me of Steve Job's obsession with getting just the right white for his products. What if a market research team was tasked with choosing the iPod's color? What if the iPod was initially released in blue... how would that have affected the success of the iPod?

This raises the question, when should we use market research and when shouldn't we? What role does market research play in design and marketing?

Steve Jobs was famous for saying that "customers don’t know what they want until we’ve shown them."

Henry Ford was famous for saying "If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, “A faster horse!”

What's the balance? I came across this article written by Bob Gilbreath, [That Steve Jobs Research Quote Should RIP](https://medium.com/@mktgwithmeaning/that-steve-jobs-research-quote-should-rip-e8f3335ec66) that argued that market research does have a specific place in designing products and experiences:

> We would never ask people, “What should we develop to make your life easier?” Instead, we spent time with people in their homes and watched them at the store, then we dug through data about what they are buying and using. Your role at the early stage of innovation is to get into the shoes of your customer, understand her life, and look for insights that give you ideas on products that you could create that would surprise and delight her.

And I agree — market research can be used to help you identify the pain points of the consumer so you can design functionality around it. This sort of market research is known as ["observation."](https://www.thebalancesmb.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-market-observation-4043445)

Market research can help put us in the shoes of the consumer, but how much can it help when it comes to making subjective design choices, like color? Perhaps the later chapters of Alchemy will give us more insight into this. At the time of writing, I believe that these subjective choices should come from a deep sense of what you or the founders of the brand believe. You can find things that represent the ideas you want to present, and go with your "gut."

The second kind of market research that Bob describes is when you get customer feedback after showing them the product you've designed. This is helpful in evaluating the functional and subjective design choices that were made. If there's valid criticism on the functional design of the product, that's probably worth taking a look at. For example, if consumers said the Red Bull's can was painful to hold, that's probably worth taking a look at.


But when it comes to criticism on the subjective design of the product, we should show caution. Just like how Red Bull taste wasn't well received, it doesn't mean the taste should be changed.
