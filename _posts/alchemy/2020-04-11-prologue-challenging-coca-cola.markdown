## Summary:

"Logical" thinking often isn't applicable in reality. For example, if you were tasked with making a competitor to Coke, a logical thinker may think something like:

<strong>"We need to produce a drink that tastes nicer than Coke, that costs less than Coke, and that comes in a really big bottle so people get value for money." (page ix)</strong>

Makes sense right? But there's one beverage that is worse tasting than Coke, more expensive, and comes in a small bottle that rivals Coke â€” Red Bull. It doesn't pay to always be logical.

## My Comments:

This reminds me of Steve Job's obsession with getting just the right white for his products. When they were designing the iPod, what if they had a market research team choose the color? What if the iPod was initially released in blue... how would that have affected the success of the iPod?

This raises the question, when should we use market research and when shouldn't we? When should we trust our guts and just experiment?
