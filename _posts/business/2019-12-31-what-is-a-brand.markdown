description: A brand doesn't stem from just a company's product or its design. On the contrary, a company's product and design are just expressions of a company's "brand." In this post we'll explore what makes a brand, a brand.

The concept of a brand is very ethereal — it's hard to define what a brand is, let alone to define what makes a brand "good." When a colleague says, "wow, that company has great branding!", what does that really mean? To a designer, a brand may be analogous to a cohesive and meaningful graphical identity. To a business person, a brand may be the products and services the company sells.

A brand, however, is neither _just_ graphic design and/or a company's product & services. It's also the story of a company, what it stands for, the culture, etc., the list goes on. A "brand" is just as much an art as it is a science — it exists in a grey area where its exact components are difficult to define.

This grey area is the reason why businesses — the ones who are supposed to know their business the best — hire branding experts and agencies to help them create a brand. The brander's job is to create order out of chaos and to create form from function. The irony, however, is that a company or their agency can't internally determine if their brand exists, or if their brand is "good", only outsiders / their users can determine that.

All one can do is to try checking as many boxes as possible, as well as possible, in hopes that it results in their market recognizing them as a brand. For the deterministic-minded people, typically businesspeople, this is probably an unsettling opinion (I very much empathize with this feeling, as I myself am the type of person who finds comfort in following a process in pursuit of a guaranteed result.) Conversely, for the indeterministic, there may be comfort in not having to follow a ten-step recipe to success.

> There's a great post by [Felicia Sullivan](https://medium.com/s/how-to-build-a-brand/lets-talk-about-how-to-build-a-brand-543b2dfbc4f5) that lists the many components of what she rightfully believes makes a brand. One can certainly follow it and may be successful in creating a brand, but the purpose of this thought-piece is to reflect on the essence of a brand's components.
