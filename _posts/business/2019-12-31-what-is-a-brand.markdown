description: A brand doesn't stem from just product or just its design. It consists of logical and psycho-logical reasons.

The concept of a brand is very ethereal â€” it's hard to define what a brand is, let alone to define what makes a brand "good." When a colleague says, "wow, that company has great branding!", what does that really mean? To a designer, a brand may be analogous to a cohesive and meaningful graphical identity. To a business person, a brand may be the products and services the company sells.

But we all know that a brand is neither _just_ graphic design or product. It's also the story of a company, what it stands for, the culture, etc., the list goes on. The concept of a "brand" exists in a gray area that can't be exactly defined (maybe that's the way it should be.)

This gray area is the reason why businesses hire "branding agencies" to help them create a brand, which agencies are more than happy to do (and many of them do it successfully.) But the ultimate irony is that a company or agency can't internally determine if a brand exists, only outsiders can determine that.

All a company or person can do is to try checking as many boxes as possible, as well as possible, in hopes that creates them a brand. For the deterministic-minded people, typically businesspeople, this is probably an unsettling opinion (I very much empathize with this feeling, as I'm the type of person who finds comfort in following a process in pursuit of a guaranteed result.) Conversely, for the indeterministic, there may be comfort in not having to follow a ten-step recipe to success.

## The Logical and the Psycho-Logical
Although we can't list out everything that goes into making a brand, we can categorize the things we do know into either being logical or psycho-logical.

Logical components are the more deterministic decisions that an economist or engineer may make. For example, the setting up of legal and accounting structures in an organization or the managing of a company's supply-chain. Another example is the marketer who only relies on data found in their market research to make decisions.

Psycho-logical components are the more "illogical" decisions that don't have an obvious direct relation to the outcome that's desired. In "Alchemy," a great example provided was how envelope design affected the amount of money donated.

A logically-minded marketer might try sending out surveys to a sample of households asking if they would donate more based on the envelope orientation. They would then act in accordance to whatever their results returned. But there is a massive flaw in this approach, people don't know why they really do things.  

The logical is a big part of what a brand consists of, without it, a company can't operate.
