description: A brand doesn't stem from just a company's product or its design. On the contrary, a company's product and design are just expressions of a company's "brand."

The concept of a brand is very ethereal — it's hard to define what a brand is, let alone to define what makes a brand "good." When a colleague says, "wow, that company has great branding!", what does that really mean? To a designer, a brand may be analogous to cohesive and meaningful visual identity. But to a business person, a brand may be the products and services the company sells.

A brand, however, is neither just a company's visual identity or their product & services. It's also the story of a company, what it stands for, the culture, etc., the list goes on. The things that make-up a "brand" are just as much an art as it is a science — they exist in a grey area.

This grey area is the reason why businesses — the ones who are _supposed_ to know themselves best — hire branding experts and agencies to help them create a brand. The brander's job is to help their clients create order out of chaos and to create meaningful form from function. But as hard as the company or brander tries, they themselves can't determine if their brand "exists", or if their brand is "good", they need validation from outsiders and their users.

All one can do is to try checking as many boxes as possible, as well as possible, in hopes that it results in their market recognizing them as a brand. For the deterministic-minded people, typically businesspeople, this is probably an unsettling opinion (I very much empathize with this feeling, as I myself am the type of person who finds comfort in following a process in pursuit of a guaranteed result.) Conversely, for the indeterministic, there may be relief in not having to follow a ten-step recipe to success.

> There's a great post by [Felicia Sullivan](https://medium.com/s/how-to-build-a-brand/lets-talk-about-how-to-build-a-brand-543b2dfbc4f5) that lists the many components of what she rightfully believes goes into creating a brand. One can certainly follow it achieve branding success, but the purpose of this thought-piece is not to talk about the exact mechanics of brand creation, but to reflect on the essence of a brand's components.

## The Nature of a Brand's Components

In the business world, decisions are typically made by using "logic," and anything that isn't "rational" or "logical", is considered not worth spending time on and is quickly thrown out the window. In the context of branding, this "logical" dogma is a dangerous one to subscribe to because it only allows a brand to be created via reductionist logic. Rory Sutherland's book, Alchemy, describes the issue of this dogma well:

> "Unfortunately, because reductionist logic has proved so reliable in the physical sciences, we now believe it must be applicable everywhere — even in the much messier field of human affairs. The models that dominate all human decision-making today are duly heavy on simplistic logic, and light on magic... what if, in our quest to recreate the certainty of the laws of physics, we are now too eager to impose the same consistency and certainty in fields where it has no place?"

There are some that don't obey this dogma — let's call them "creatives" because we typically find these kind of people in the creative field — that instinctively seem to understand that there's an "irrational" component to the branding process. (In my opinion, the difference in philosophy between the businessperson and creative is the reason for most disconnects between the two parties.)

This irrationality is not welcomed by most businesspeople, because it's not something they can back-up with reductionist logic when speaking to their superiors or boardroom. This makes it very difficult for irrationality or "magic" as Sutherland calls it to do its part in a brand.


## The Case for Irrationality

Steve Jobs was famous for his obsession for getting just the right white for Apple's products. This neuroticism, however, was not understood by the "rational" people around him. At the time, that was Mike Scott (newly brought in president of Apple for the purpose of "reigning in" Jobs) and even his co-founder, Steve Wozniak.

Although many could argue that the shade of white or even the color wouldn't have really mattered, that's only easy to say in hindsight. Let's imagine a world where Apple hired a market research firm to look into which colors would be most popular using surveys, focus groups, etc. Now imagine they came back with any color **but** white...

> That's not to say that market research doesn't have its place — because it certainly does, it's just that it's not _always_ correct or even safe to listen to. To be fair, the irrationality that Sutherland describes is more about using psycho-logic (heuristics, behavioral economics, etc.) to come up with unconventional solutions, instead of simple reductionist logic (like raw market research).

So, if we can't just use market research, where does the essence of a brand come from?

I think, like Steve Jobs, it comes from a mixture of vision, creativeness, and instinct (which often times may seem irrational). The designers job (whether internally or externally) is extremely difficult because they have to take this whirlwind of product, culture, vision, rationality, irrationality and create something that represents or fairly expresses that.

Nowadays, good designers are expected to ask thoughtful questions about their client's company, mission, their market, their competitors, etc. But the best designers take that one step further and either consciously or subconsciously try to understand the true desire or feelings of their clients (which is typically unexplainable).
