description: A brand doesn't stem from just a company's product or its design. On the contrary, a company's product and design are just expressions of a company's "brand."

The concept of a brand is very ethereal — it's hard to define what a brand is, let alone to define what makes a brand "good." When a colleague says, "wow, that company has great branding!", what does that really mean? To a designer, a brand may be analogous to cohesive and meaningful visual identity. But to a business person, a brand may be the products and services the company sells.

A brand, however, is neither just a company's visual identity or their product & services. It's also the story of a company, what it stands for, the culture, etc., the list goes on. The things that make-up a "brand" are just as much an art as it is a science — they exist in a grey area.

This grey area is the reason why businesses — the ones who are _supposed_ to know themselves best — hire branding experts and agencies to help them create a brand. The brander's job is to help their clients create order out of chaos and to create meaningful form from function. But as hard as the company or brander tries, they themselves can't determine if their brand "exists", or if their brand is "good", they need validation from outsiders and their users.

All one can do is to try checking as many boxes as possible, as well as possible, in hopes that it results in their market recognizing them as a brand. For the deterministic-minded people, typically businesspeople, this is probably an unsettling opinion (I very much empathize with this feeling, as I myself am the type of person who finds comfort in following a process in pursuit of a guaranteed result.) Conversely, for the indeterministic, there may be relief in not having to follow a ten-step recipe to success.

> There's a great post by [Felicia Sullivan](https://medium.com/s/how-to-build-a-brand/lets-talk-about-how-to-build-a-brand-543b2dfbc4f5) that lists the many components of what she rightfully believes goes into creating a brand. One can certainly follow it achieve branding success, but the purpose of this thought-piece is not to talk about the exact mechanics of brand creation, but to reflect on the essence of a brand's components.

## A Brand's Components

In the business world, decisions are typically made using "logic," and anything that isn't "rational" or "logical", is considered not worth spending time on and thrown out the window. It's the reason why agencies of all sorts have a hard time getting on the same page with their clients. In the context of branding, the dogma ruled by logic is a dangerous mindset to have, because a brand isn't a result of reductionist logic. Rory Sutherland's book, Alchemy, describes this dogma well:

> "Unfortunately, because reductionist logic has proved so reliable in the physical sciences, we now believe it must be applicable everywhere — even in the much messier field of human affairs. The models that dominate all human decision-making today are duly heavy on simplistic logic, and light on magic... what if, in our quest to recreate the certainty of the laws of physics, we are now too eager to impose the same consistency and certainty in fields where it has no place?"
