description: A brand doesn't stem from just a company's product or its design. On the contrary, a company's product and design are just expressions of a company's "brand." In this post we'll explore the make-up of a brand.

The concept of a brand is very ethereal — it's hard to define what a brand is, let alone to define what makes a brand "good." When a colleague says, "wow, that company has great branding!", what does that really mean? To a designer, a brand may be analogous to cohesive and meaningful graphical identity. To a business person, a brand may be the products and services the company sells.

A brand, however, is neither just a company's graphic design or their product & services. It's also the story of a company, what it stands for, the culture, etc., the list goes on. A "brand" is just as much an art as it is a science — it exists in a grey area where its components are difficult to exactly define.

This grey area is the reason why businesses — the ones who are _supposed_ to know themselves best — hire branding experts and agencies to help them create a brand. The brander's job is to help their clients create order out of chaos and to create meaningful form from function. The irony, however, is that a company can't determine if their brand "exists", or if their brand is "good" by themselves, they need validation from outsiders and their users.

All one can do is to try checking as many boxes as possible, as well as possible, in hopes that it results in their market recognizing them as a brand. For the deterministic-minded people, typically businesspeople, this is probably an unsettling opinion (I very much empathize with this feeling, as I myself am the type of person who finds comfort in following a process in pursuit of a guaranteed result.) Conversely, for the indeterministic, there may be relief in not having to follow a ten-step recipe to success.

One can certainly follow it and may be successful in creating a brand, but the purpose of this thought-piece is not to talk about the exact mechanics of creating a brand, but to reflect on the essence of a brand's components.

Whatever way you decide to "chop-up" and attack brand creation or management, there
