There are a few obvious definitions for the word “experience.” In everyday language, experience usually refers to the practical skills and knowledge gained from doing and seeing things.

In the context of work, having experience is often one of the main criteria in any job posting. The more senior the job, the more experience one needs in order to get said job. “Experience” serves as a catch all phrase that encompasses the general idea that “vetted” industry experience is vital to getting hired. Although experience is typically defined in years, the qualitative nature of that experience is rarely made explicit.

I think an alternate, but insightful definition of experience is: *learning what’s okay or “acceptable” to do.*

Although the above definition doesn’t capture the entire meaning of the word “experience,” I think it highlights an important and less thought-about part of it.

A few examples from my own journey to illustrate my point:

- **You learn that it’s okay to have an opinion.** When you’re in school, you’re taught that “facts” are more important than opinions (usually implicitly, but also explicitly in stricter schooling systems and cultures)
    - As you gain “experience,” you learn that it’s not only okay to have your own opinion, but that it’s vital to the success of your career! The market rewards you for having an informed opinion that no one else has.
        - Micro Level
            - An associate who constantly brings up suggestions (even if they’re wrong or ill-informed in the beginning) will learn more (and thus have greater chances of success) than the one who stays quiet. Why? Because one, they draw attention to themselves and two, if they’re scientific in their suggestions, they will only get better and better over time.
                - In today’s world where attention is a currency, even uninformed opinions seem to do well, as they attract the attention of others.
        - Macro Level
            - AirBnB - No one thought that an AirBnb made sense, even some of the best investors in the world. The most successful entrepreneurs start their businesses based on their opinions.
    - Facts are often easier to find than “good” opinions. 
- **You learn that it’s okay to not be formal all of the time.** But you should be professional at all times, there’s a difference.
    - You’ll usually get along with people better if you behave like yourself.
    - There seems to be a correlation between formality and experience. The more experienced one is, the less formal they seem to be or are allowed to be. Probably because people in power can afford to be less formal; they aren’t afraid of getting fired for how someone else perceives them.
        - This is also relative. A CEO who feels okay being casual with other CEOs of similar success might feel uncomfortable being casual around an Elon Musk. Elon Musk seems to be able to be casual with anyone.
        - Thus, casualness can be a signal of confidence and security and formality is usually a signal of nervousness and sometimes, insecurity. 
- **You learn that everyone doesn’t know what they’re doing.** Everyone’s figuring it out as they go. Your superiors might seem put together with answers to everything, but they’re just as lost as you, relatively speaking. 
- **You learn that it’s okay to turn away business.** When you’re green, you typically think all business is good business. Money is money! But over time, you realize that this isn’t true. Time and focus is often more important than short term, monetary gains.
    - Not all business is good business. Not all money is good money.

Everyone will have different starting points based on how they were raised, their culture, etc. But the idea remains the same - you’ll learn that certain things are “okay” that you didn’t think were “okay” before. Be conscious and aware of your preconceptions and learn by observing others. Over time, you’ll add to your repertoire of behaviors and increase the amount of “cards” you can play. But of course, to do that, you’ll need exposure to all sorts of people and situations, which takes time, and hence the adage that experience comes with time.
