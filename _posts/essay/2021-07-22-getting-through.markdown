I enjoy speaking and connecting with people, whether it's at my job (as of July 2021 I do sales as part of my full-time job,) or personal life. I've always been interested in figuring out how to get people to open up so that I may have the chance to create a meaningful bond with them. I think it's a useful skill not only in sales but also just for living a more enjoyable and social life - especially because I'm very introverted.

For the most part, when meeting new people, I think there are two conflicting feelings in a person - one - the fear of sharing and opening up - and two - the desire to open up and share. People often put up walls (they can have more than one) and boundaries in order to protect themselves as an act of self preservation. But on the other hand, when given the chance, people love talking about themselves. It's a strange duality that most people have. But it also makes things pretty simple - if you can help the other party put down their walls, it will be easy for you to establish a deeper than shallow relationship with them.

Ultimately, I think the way to get past someone's barriers is to let them know you're not a threat. There are many ways to let other people know you're not a threat, for example by using humor. Conan O'Brien is amazing at this, he's not scared of making a fool of himself in front of others, and that makes people laugh and open up to him. But there's more happening behind the scenes than just being funny, it's a combination of being genuine and being the first to "open up". It signals to the other person that you've let down your walls and that it's okay for them to let down theirs (neurologically, it's probably because it fires off mirror neurons in the other party.)

>"When you can be a representative of a country and the poorest of them get to laugh at you, because you're ridiculous, you're 6"4, your hair looks like a pastry, you have no color in your skin, you have no lips, don't seem to have any testosterone, your legs are way too long, torso way too short... this is sad... but when all this comes out and they can laugh at you, it's actually a beautiful thing." - Conan O'Brien

Unfortunately, most of us can't be nearly as funny as Conan, especially not myself. But what we can take away from Conan is that if we're the first to put down our guard and be genuine, that might help the other person feel comfortable being genuine as well.

A common piece of advice that I see people give when it comes to getting others to like them / open up to them is to ask questions. Asking questions gets the counter party to talk about themselves and signals to them that you are interested in what they have to say. This lets the counter party feel that they can put down one wall - the fear of sharing due to enthusiasm not being reciprocated - which is a common and big fear that people have.

And although I do think asking questions work in the majority of situations, there's a weird meta game that develops around people who have heard that advice before. You'll run into people, especially experienced business people or people who have more walls, for whatever reason, that are self-aware that others are trying to get them to open up and will try to resist. When I'm in conversation with these sort of people, I flip the strategy, instead of just asking questions, I also talk about myself. It might be counterintuitive to the "don't talk about yourself" advice, but again, it signals to the other person that it's okay to talk about themselves. In  some situations, with certain kinds of people, when you talk about yourself, you impose on them a sort of "debt," they feel that because you shared something, they have to share something as well.

Getting through to people is like a boxing match. You're jabbing to figure out their defense by asking a question, seeing how they react, talking about yourself, see how they react, so on and so forth until you figure out their defense and get through.

Sometimes you don't get through and that person doesn't want to open up to you, and that's fine, I'm not mad.
