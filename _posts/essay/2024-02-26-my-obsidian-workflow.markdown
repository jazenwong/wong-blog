Note: I'm sure the way that I use Obsidian will evolve. This post reflects my process as of 2/26/24.

I moved over from Evernote to Obsidian around three years ago. It wasn't until recently when I saw [kepano's](https://twitter.com/kepano) (Steph Ango, Obsidian's CEO) Twitter post that I had an epiphany: I probably wasn't using Obsidian to its maximum potential <a href="#note1">[1]</a>.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Power went out in my neighborhood while I am coincidentally re-reading Mother Earth Mother Board by <a href="https://twitter.com/nealstephenson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nealstephenson</a> for an essay I&#note39;m working on. An apt quote as I sit here by candlelight:<br><br>&quot;Today, another 120 years later, we take wires completely for granted. This is most… <a href="https://t.co/Un1e3wkjIp">pic.twitter.com/Un1e3wkjIp</a></p>&mdash; kepano (@kepano) <a href="https://twitter.com/kepano/status/1760147688690184569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I noticed that Steph had his graph view pulled up next to his notes and I thought to myself, "huh, that's weird. I never once thought it would be useful to have that up <a href="#note2">[2]</a>." Curious to know what I was missing, I tweet-replied Steph suggesting that he make a a video walkthrough of how he uses Obsidian. (Given my reply had the most likes in the thread, I figured that I wasn't the only curious one.)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You should do a video walkthrough of how you use obsidian</p>&mdash; James Wong (@jwazen1) <a href="https://twitter.com/jwazen1/status/1760201652177416624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

He didn't reply. In any case, I decided to do my own research.

Now, although I've dug through Obsidian's resources and documentation a few times in the past, I've never found a tutorial or explanation that's clicked for me. But after a few hours of research, I stumbled on [Andy Matuschak's site](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak), "Working Notes".

(It's a really cool site, [you should check it out for yourself](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=zPKTSiU725W9WQCqoVPBcxm&stackedNotes=zMX9Lfuz8sGfDUivWZcyWT&stackedNotes=zQeW31KRF1tk2zCPPGWc7UD&stackedNotes=zDV9WUPTpX5MbZb4UJEwXr1.).)

A few things stood out to me:

- **There was no file explorer, index, or search bar.** You had to navigate completely via interlinks.
- **There didn't seem to be any particular naming convention for notes.** They could be full sentences or a single word.
- **Interlinks would often be used to "complete" a sentence grammatically.**

This inspired me to create a new Obsidian vault <a href="#note3">[3]</a> and start from scratch, with a few "rules":

1. **Interlinking wouldn't be an afterthought.** Whenever I fleshed out a note, I would be extremely mindful about what I was writing. If I wrote a sentence or word that I intuitively felt could be expounded upon, I would immediately turn it into a link. I wouldn't change the link's name or try to use a naming convention.
2. **After creating a new note, I would spend five to ten minutes seeing if it could be linked to any existing notes.** As your vault gets larger, it becomes more difficult to do this, but I felt it was important to be thoughtful about each new note and its potential connections.
3. **I would try my best to navigate only using graph view.** I realized that navigating via the side panel / file explorer made it too easy to leverage habits and heuristics based in hierarchal thinking. The idea here is that if I were to challenge the way I organized and thought about knowledge, I should change the way I looked for it.

I took a random note from my old vault and used it as a starting point.

The note was titled "不会吃".

![Don't know how to eat](/assets/blogimages/obsidian/Bu_Hui_Chi.png#background "Don't know how to eat")

As I started writing about the note, I wrote a sentence that stood out to me: "taste evolves based on new life experiences." I immediately turned the sentence into a link by enclosing it with double brackets (e.g. [[taste evolves based on new life experiences.]] ).

Mimicking Steph, I had my graph view pulled up alongside my current note. So when I double-clicked the link to turn it into a note, I noticed that a new node popped up on the graph, which was pretty interesting. I didn't know what to make of it at the time, but it was a fundamentally different experience from just adding a new file via the explorer (right click and create file).

After finishing up my thoughts on 不会吃, I immediately turned to the new note, "taste evolves based on new life experiences," and applied the same principles.

As I did this a few more times, I realized two things, 1, I was having a lot of fun, and 2, finding connections between ideas was a lot easier than before because it became a natural part of the note creation process. Instead of trying to figure out which folder and subfolders I should categorize my notes and ideas into, they organically found their place.

It was also really cool to be able to follow the path of a note from one topic to a completely different one. Navigation felt much more exploratory and much less rigid.

A few challenges that I encountered:

- **It's really hard to keep notes "atomic".** Encapsulating a note to only be about itself is a lot harder than it seems.
- **It's tempting to make connections even when they shouldn't exist.** I think this was a behavior that arose due to "overcorrecting".

I don't think these are problems per se, it just forces you to be more intentional and mindful of what you write and the connections you make, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

I'm sure as time goes on, new challenges will arise that will force me to rethink this workflow, but for now, it's working and I'm having a lot of fun.

<span id="note2">[2] Whenever I saw Obsidian graphs in the wild, it would always be a massive web of interconnections. Intuitively I thought to myself, "there's no way that could be useful to any human". But Steph's graph view only had a depth setting of 1, which is completely legible, and that convinced me to re-explore how I used Obsidian.</span>
