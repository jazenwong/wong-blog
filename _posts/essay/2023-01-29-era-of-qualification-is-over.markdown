I've been sitting on this idea for a while and came across an [article](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/12/who-gains-and-loses-from-the-new-ai.html) that put it well:

> "The returns to factual knowledge are falling, continuing a trend that started with databases, search engines and Wikipedia. It is no longer so profitable to be a lawyer who knows a large amount of accumulated case law. Instead, the skills of synthesis and persuasion are more critical for success."

This applies to almost every field, not just the legal industry. Factual knowledge will become very easy to attain and transactional work that's based on factual knowledge will become even more commoditized. In a few years, many accountants, software engineers, or lawyers will feel this disruption.

Conversely, what will become much more valuable will be the ability to be resourceful, to work hard, to think critically, and to persuade others. Although these qualities have always been more valuable than transactional work, AI and other tools will quickly accelerate the delta by increasing leverage of those who use it (most of the time to replace commoditized, transactional work).

The important takeaway for many of my colleagues and friends, especially the younger ones, is that you can't be idle; you need to invest as much time as possible to not become a commodity because when the disruption comes, it will be quick.

Here are some fields that will probably outlive and even benefit from this trend:

**Working hard**: Entrepreneurship; [enterprise software](http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html).

**Critical Thinking / Resourcefulness**: Product managers; high end creative and design fields.

**Persuasion**: Enterprise sales of all sorts - whether SaaS, investment banking, etc.

Having a degree or qualification hasn't mattered much for a while, and this will only become more and more true. What will matter is your creativity and willpower to force things into existence.
